# CollectionView Challenge

Following up on the [Visual Challenge](https://github.com/davidortinau/VisualChallenge), the CollectionView Challenge is aimed at taking a previous or current project's ListView and convert it to the new CollectionView.

_Note: Some functionality may not be (fully) implemented yet as of this time. We're working to make sure that it is, but we still want your feedback on what's available now!_

## Challenge Quick Start

1. Fork this repository
2. Open `CollectionViewChallengePage.xaml`
3. Take a ListView from another project, previous or current, and convert it to a CollectionView, replacing the placeholder on the page. If you need to, you can replace any data with placeholders; the goal is to replicate the functionality that your app's ListView utilizes.
4. Submit a pull request of your progress back to this repository. Please include the following feedback:
   - Comparison screenshots of your results! If you really want to go the extra mile, video is awesome to see, too.
   - Your experience converting the `ListView` to a `CollectionView` (Any difficulties?)
   - How is the performance compared to the `ListView`?
   - Is there anything missing that you'd like to see?

`CollectionView` docs can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/collectionview/).
