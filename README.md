# CollectionView Challenge

Following up on the Visual challenge, the CollectionView challenge is aimed at taking a current project's ListView and convert it to the new CollectionView. This challenge will function similarly to the Visual challenge.

## Challenge Quick Start

1. Fork this repository
2. Open `CollectionViewChallengePage.xaml`
3. Take a ListView from another project, previous or current, and convert it to a CollectionView, replacing the placerholder on the page. If you need to, you can replace any data with placeholders; the goal is to simulate the general functionality that your app's ListView utilizes.
4. Submit a pull request of your progress back to this repository. Please include the following feedback:
   - Your experience converting the `ListView` to a `CollectionView` (Any difficulties?)
   - How is the performance compared to the `ListView`?
   - Is there anything missing that you'd like to see?

`CollectionView` docs can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/collectionview/).
